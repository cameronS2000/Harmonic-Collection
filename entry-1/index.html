        <h1>iPhone Photography and It's Place in its Field</h1>
        <p> the convenience of mobile phone cameras forever changed the 
            process and accesibility of photography.

    <h2>realism and artistic value</h2>
    <p>As photography became an available technology to society, the value of realism in the arts became less relavent.</p>
    <p>As a result, artists became more interested in abstraction.</p>
    <p>This change in job specification allowed the artist to focus on the general aspects of their pieces like composition, color, and subject.</p>
    <p>I believe a similar movement is taking place in photography.</p>
    <h3>accessibility and excess</h3>
    <p>Nearly every member of society having access to a camera at all times means that every moment can be captured.</p>
    <p>This allows for a similar abstract freedom that was presented to artists in the mid 1800s</p>
    <p>This makes room for the appreciation of pixelated, over-exposed, or blurry photographs.</p>
