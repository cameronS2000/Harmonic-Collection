         <p> This photograph exhbits the colors, textures, and shapes of scaffolding as well 
            as a distorted landscape behind a plastic tarp. My favorite photographs 
            are often of the mundane, monotonous, and boring things that we pass in our 
            everyday lives. This construction site stands between the camera and an expansive 
            view of the Swiss Alps. This image asks whether the mountains add to the beauty 
            of the construction site or the construction site subtracts from the beauty of the
            mountains.

            Depicted in this photo is a steam covered shower door, backed by a window shining 
            light through various bottles. What makes this photo interesting to me is the variability 
            of depth. The viewer can allow their eyes to switch between the foreground and background
            exploring the different textures, colors, and contrasts.

            This photograph represents my idea of an ideal portrait. The subject looks 
            well lit, comfortable, and in a natural setting. The smart phone shines in 
            its ability to create spontaneous photos like these; capturing true moments 
            in contrast to an artificially produced photoshoot.
