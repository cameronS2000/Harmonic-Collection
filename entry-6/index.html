            <div class="subtitle">In comparing two photographs, we're able to transcend the timeless nature
                of the still photograph. On the left, you will find photographs before some event transpired.
                On the right you will find the result. In this webpage I hope to add depth and complexity to
                the comprehension of any one of the images. Although these photos tell a story together, it's only a 
                small section of the much larger plot they take part in.

                    eaves outside my bedroom window. I've always wondered if it was the same family coming back to
                 build a nest each year. </p>

                    with me through love and heart break. I wore them while I layed fiberglass on surfboard blanks.
                    I wore them to the store. Eventually they broke and so I threw them away.

                    feel kind of guilty that she has to go around being called Rodger.. She wasn't even a year old when
                    she involuntarily became a mother. I feel kind of guilty about that too.

                    them and spent every moment with themâ€”sometimes forgetting to eat. Of course we couldn't keep seven cats
                    so we gave them away to friends and relatives. She was really depressed for maybe two weeks? But then I
                    guess she forgot because she's fine now. I often wonder if she thinks about her kids.

                    laughing too because they weren't very welcoming at this restaurant. There were multiple times while traveling in 
                    Switzerland that I blindly ordered food off of the non-English menu. I don't remember what this was called
                    or what I thought I was going to recieve, but I guess it tasted good enough for me to finish it.
