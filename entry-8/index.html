         This is a photo I took of my sister petting her bunny shoes.</p>

        <p>My cousin (in the back of the image) is only 16 years old. He was upset to 
            learn that the bar was checking IDs. To try and get around this issue he made an extra
            long straw to try and sneak sips from other peoples' drinks. For the record his plan did 
            not result in success.

        <p>My cousins have been an important part of my life since I was little. We were all excited
            to see each other after I'd been in New York for a few months.
