    <h2>This is a photo of a poster hung outside of a workwear store. I like to imagine them in the studio going "Okay now sit down and make a face like your knee hurts really bad." and he does it because it's what he's being payed to do. I wonder if he'd expected a more glamorous reality when he first considered modeling.</h2>
