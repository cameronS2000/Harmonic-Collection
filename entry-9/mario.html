    <h2>I really enjoy the absurdities of New York. I'm entertained on multiple levels when I see something like mario smoking a bong painted onto a window. What a gift to see him in a new context. I wonder if it was the owner's request or the artists idea. Is this bringing in sales? I hope it is but it's definitely not the approach I'd come up with first. </h2>
